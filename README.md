[Article Title]{Data-Oriented IASPNet: Instance-Aware Sampling Point Network for LiDAR Point Cloud Classification}
abstract{Driven by artificial intelligence technology, point cloud classification has become an important topic in 3D computer vision. The classification accuracy of LiDAR point cloud directly impacts its application effect in various fields such as autonomous vehicles and robot navigation. Despite the emergence of numerous advanced neural network models, increasing network complexity has not consistently translated into significant performance gains. Upon closer examination, we traced back to the beginning and found that benchmark methods typically employ non-data-oriented sampling strategies, such as random sampling or farthest point sampling, for progressively downsampling the input point cloud. This is suboptimal, these sampling algorithms ignore the varying importance of each point, as not all points contribute equally to the classification task. To address this limitation, we propose a novel data-oriented instance-aware sampling point network (IASPNet) for point cloud classification. 
In the proposed IASPNet, a data-oriented instance-aware sampling algorithm is tailored to the spatial feature of the input point cloud, which selectively preserves the key points that can characterize the spatial feature, enabling more efficient downsampling. In conjunction with this algorithm, an instance-aware feature learning module is built and incorporated into the point-based backbone network to enhance feature extraction capability. 
Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed IASPNet is validated through extensive experiments on open datasets, showing the improvement of performance metrics across ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN and ShapeNetPart, each dataset represents varying degrees of complexity. Especially on the challenging ShapeNetPart dataset of the fine-grained classification, the Instance mIoU reached 87.24\% and Class mIoU reached 85.46\%, which reached the expected performance comparable to the current advanced methods.}
